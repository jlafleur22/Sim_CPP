# Overview

I began this project out of a desire to learn C++ and further my understanding of how coding effects processing at the machine level.

This software is a farming simulator that allows a user to make certain decisions about the administration of their farmland in order to see if they can turn a profit from it 
or not. This software demonstrates proficiency with variables, expressions, conditionals, loops, functions, classes and data structures from the standard library including
vectors and lists. It demonstrates dynamic code by reading user input and pulling associated files from lists to display relevant information to provide feedback to the user
and advance the scenario.

I wanted to learn C++. I really wanted to branch out into other languages, and thought C++, with its ability to really effect the efficiency of how our code is processed on a 
machine level, would be a great place to start.

# Development Environment

I used Microsoft Visual Studio to develop this software. Visual Studio was fairly easy to use after watching a short tutorial on how to set up, compile and run a simple program.
You will need to install a compiler to run this program. There are several options, here are two for you to peruse.
* [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
* [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/download/#section=windows)

{Describe the programming language that you used and any libraries.}
I used C++ to develop this program. I used the standard library, the c standard library, the in/out stream, 
the string library and the  the file stream. This allowed me to utilize many inbuilt functions within C++ to utilize my code.

# Future Work

* Create system to allow for more team focused development (using .txt files for writers, and creating systems to scan/display them)
* Create save/load system for user to continue their experience from previous save point
* Optimize code for greater processing efficiency
